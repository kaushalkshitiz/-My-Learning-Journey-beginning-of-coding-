#    My Learning Journey : beginning of coding
ðŸš€ My Python Learning Journey: first repo documenting my Harvard CS50 Python course. This repo is a learning log, practice ground, and portfolio. I chose Python for its readability and beginner-friendliness. Future goals: learn new languages, specialize in AI/ML, and expand projects. Thanks for visiting!
